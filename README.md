# Parser Combinators in c++ 


### Implement Parser Combinators according blog as  https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/understanding-parser-combinators/

Not finished and will not update anymore, becasue I am borther .

Current state is to add position and context to error messages, any pull requests are welcome! 
Build using visual studio 2017.

Next big thing to implement is to support recursive variant , (the data type is support by mapbox), and can  recursively parse  recursive data structure (like lisp, json etc).
